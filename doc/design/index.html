<h2>RESTful Web Service design doc</h2>
<p>The system is divided in 3 basic units:
	<ul>
  <li>Places</li>
  <li>Vehicles</li>
  <li>Connections</li>
</ul> 
By using the GET method is possible to retives the list of the respectevely elements. To manage the great possible amount of data, a paging system has been implemented. Each lists can be accesses by dividing them in pages, this can improve performance. Is also possible to accessing to a selected page directly.<br/><br/>
Single place can be accessed by using the proper {id}, in this case the paging is not require. A place can't have an infinite number of connections to other places.<br/><br/>
Also a single vehicle can be accessed directly. The suggested path can become really huge in relation to a wolrd-scale system. The retriving of the path is also divided in pages, the first page is always included, the others can be accessed separately.<br/><br/>
Al kind of classes make use of link to other rescources to simplify the use of the APIs, also the ID of the stuffs (Plate or Place) is available.<br/><br/>
The system use the basic HTTP Error Code:

<table style="border: 1px solid black;">
	<tr><th>Error</th><th>Type</th><th>Usage</th></tr>
	<tr><td>200</td><td>OK</td><td>Correct execution</td></tr>
	<tr><td>401</td><td>Not Authorized</td><td>Used when the request require the admin option</td></tr> 
	<tr><td>403</td><td>Forbidden</td><td>Used when some request can't be accepted due to logical error (GateType)</td></tr> 
	<tr><td>404</td><td>Not Found</td><td>Resource asked not founded</td></tr> 
	<tr><td>409</td><td>Conflict</td><td>Trying to add a resource already available (ID) in the system</td></tr>
	<tr><td>422</td><td>Unprocessable Entity</td><td>Retrived when some vehicle actions make use of not correct places or other similar stuff</td></tr> 
</table>
